Chess games
===========

Some of my chess games I for some reason enjoyed, annotated with varied effort
put.

I'm a terrible chess player, so the quality of my play is generally awful.
Hanging pieces and blunders galore!
However, some of the games I've played are memorable for me for one reason or
another.
It may have been an epiphany I've been enlightened with while looking for a
move, or a picturesque, unusual position, or the fact that I was simply in a
good mood while playing a game.
The quality of my play is generally not one of the factors that decide whether
the game will end up in this collection or not.
This is also not an attempt to improve my chess, so you won't find many (or
any, frankly) of my losses here, although they are perhaps much more worth
analyzing in case one's a good student.
