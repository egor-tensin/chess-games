{An example of how badly wrong openings can go. Not my kind of wrong (like when
I hang a piece on move 10), but seriously wrong in a positional way. Also, this
dude was rated about the same as me, and I checked his games after the game:
in every single one of them his openings were simply atrocious. But his rating
was still quite high by my standards, so this is a lesson how managing your
time properly can be more advantageous than thinking about one's openings too
much (which I do to no success).}
