{It's weird how blind both me and my opponent were. I thought I was being extra
clever, but in fact I was just delusional.}

  (53...c4+ {wins the bishop, but another mistake is that his King is no longer
able to escape using the black squares (after something like Rf6, Rg6, Kg5,
Kf6). Or maybe not, I don't know. I'm still lost, of course.})

difference with the position I had 20 moves ago.})

65.Kc4 {I think that would've been a brililant move if both the g- and h-files
didn't exist somehow.}
65...Bc3 {We both completely forgot about that fact.}
66.Kb5 {Another "brilliancy" from me. I not gonna capture that bishop until
absolutely necessary! In fact, both Kc4 and Kb5 lose, of course, since the
bishop can make to the d8-h4 diagonal in time.}
