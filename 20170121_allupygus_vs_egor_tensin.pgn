{Winning a blitz game against a 1500+-rated player + doing this an exchange
down is something to remember for me. Also, I'm on a winning streak, so every
game is precious.}

  (16...Rxc4 {is just a free pawn.})
17.Bxe4 Bxe4
18.Nd6 Bc6
19.Nxc8 Qxc8 {I'm simply down an exchange for nothing. I didn't resign since I
thought I would have some chances with my unopposed white squared bishop, which
somehow proved to be correct in this game.}
20.Qb3 {Playing into my hand.} b5 {Now my bishop is getting really strong.}
21.c5 Bd5
22.Qc3 Qb7
23.Ba3 Rc8
24.Bb4 Bxg2 {Now I have the upper hand, according to my engine.}

28.Qa3 Qe4 {The kind of positions I lose routinely, having the extra exchange.}
29.Bc3 {The fatal mistake.} Bd5
30.Kf1 Bc4+
31.Kg1 Bd5 {I thought about taking a draw in case my opponent repeats (as
usual, I was in time trouble), but probably I would play on, since my opponent
can't really do anything.}
32.Rf6 {Just silly.}
  (32.Kf1 Bh6 {was the move I intended to play, and it gets really sharp.}
    (32...Ra8 {is even stronger, and sharper. Not at all sure I would've won
this. For example, if White tries to keep his extra material, he gets mated
rather quickly, but that would've been very tricky to play out.} 33.Qb2 Qh1+
