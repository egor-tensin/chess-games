{I'm trying to switch to 1.d4 now, so I'm always scared when my opponents play
lines I don't know. Here, an attempt to hold on to the "sacrificed" pawn was
refuted (taking into account our modest ratings). I'm putting a lot of hope
into thinking that the level of my play is now sufficient to refute these
unsound attempts.}
