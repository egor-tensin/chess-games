{The first 15+10 game I've played after a long blitz vacation. I would've lost
like a billion rating points in case of a loss, hence the relief after I won.
Also, a pretty pawn sacrifice (like a bait) that my opponent swallowed,
allowing me to checkmate him.}

13.Nd5 Nxd5
14.cxd5 f5
15.Bxg7 Kxg7
16.Rc1 Rf7 {It's been another terribly played King's Indian so far. My opponent
has a significant advantage, but goes a bit astray.}
17.g4 {He's not gonna castle queenside, so I thought this only weakened his
King and gave me some chances.}
17...fxg4
18.f4 Nf3+
19.Nxf3 gxf3
20.Bxf3 Bg4
21.Bxg4 hxg4 {My plan was to attack his somewhat weakened e-, f- and h-pawns.}
  (21...Qxe4+ {Yeah, I don't notice things like that. What a sneaky check!})
22.Rc4 Qe7 {As per usual, I went wrong on almost every move in this endgame.}
  ({For example, I thought that} 22...b5 {is refuted by} 23.Rc6 {attacking the
weakest of my pawns on c7, but in fact it runs into the same check I missed on
the previous move.})
23.Kf2 Rh8
24.Kg3 {I missed the whole plan of waking the King towards g4, causing me to
enter the panic mode. Curiously enough, I was at least equal (mostly better)
since 17.g4. Anyway, out of desperation, I found the only move which, I
thought, would keep me in the game. In fact, it simply gives me quite a huge
advantage, according to my engine.}
24...g5 {I'm kind of proud of it, I don't make moves like this every day.}
25.Qd4+ Kg8
26.fxg5 Qf8
27.Kxg4 {My point exactly. I saw this, and the finish.}
  ({No idea how the game would've ended had he played something like} 27.Rc3
{instead.})
