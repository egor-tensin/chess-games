{Continuing my winning streak against 1500+ players. This game was memorable
becase I played virtually perfectly by my standards. Lichess' computer analysis
said I only made a single inaccuracy during the entire game (with no mistakes
and no blunders), which I'm quite proud of.}

I hang a piece on move 10), but seriously wrong in a positional way. Also, this
dude was rated about the same as me, and I checked his games after the game:
in every single one of them his openings were simply atrocious. But his rating
was still quite high by my standards, so this is a lesson how managing your
