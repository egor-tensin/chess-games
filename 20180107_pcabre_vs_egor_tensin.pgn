{I've played quite a few decent games since the last time I added anything
here, but lost my desire to put anything here, apparently. However, this game
was so emotionally satisfying, I can't help it.}
1.e4 c6
2.Nf3 d5
3.exd5 cxd5
4.d4 Nf6
5.Bd3! ({Much stronger then the anticipated} 5.Bf4) Bf5 {A premove, obviously.}
6.Bxf5 {I was so bitter at this point that I decided to hang on till the end.
I do that from time time, but can't remember getting a draw even once. Plus, I
drew two exchanges up (albeit, against a much higher-rated opponent) earlier
that day, so I was more desperate than I usually am.}

14.Qd3 Qc7
15.Bf4 Bd6 {Shuffling around my Bishop and Queen like that didn't inspire much
confidence though.}
16.Qg3 {Kind of what I was hoping for. Now there's more life and imbalance to
the position I though.} Nxd4
17.cxd4 Qxc2
18.Bxh6 Nh5 {A defensive tactic I've seen a lot, but possibly this was the
first time I got the chance to execute it myself. Watch this Knight sacrifice
itself!}

20.g4 Kh8
21.gxh5 gxh6
22.Qxh6+ Kg8 {A draw I'd be more than satisfied with.}

24...Qxa1
25.h6 (25.Nd7 Rg8 Nf6+ {was missed by both of us.}) Rg8
