{The first time I played vs. by far the most frequent opponent of mine,
Vladimir_VP. We played 23 games, the score being +9-9=5. His account was later
suspended for "Fair Play" violations. Not sure what was this all about, but
I suspect he was accused of cheating. He did gain a few hundred rating points
in a very short time span, but I did beat him and made a few draws. It was very
nice actually: we arranged games, and sort of became buddies over the Internet.
He was very polite, and a better chess player. I miss those times, and a few of
the games were really interesting, so I'm annotating a few to commemorate. The
first game ended after a silly blunder by me.}
